## About This Blog Series

This comprehensive guide takes a first principles approach to deploying n8n on Azure Kubernetes Service. Rather than just providing configuration files, we explore the reasoning behind each design decision and build up a production-grade system step by step.

Each section builds upon the previous ones, creating a complete deployment that is:
- **Scalable**: Handles growing workflow needs
- **Reliable**: Ensures workflows execute consistently
- **Secure**: Protects sensitive data and access
- **Maintainable**: Simplifies ongoing operations

Whether you're new to n8n, Kubernetes, or Azure, this guide will help you understand not just how to deploy n8n, but why each component is configured the way it is.

## How to Use This Guide

You can read this guide from beginning to end for a complete understanding of n8n deployment on AKS, or jump to specific sections if you're interested in particular aspects of the implementation.

All configuration files and scripts mentioned in this guide are available in the accompanying [GitHub repository](https://github.com/devs-hooked/n8n-azure-k8s).

Happy automating!
