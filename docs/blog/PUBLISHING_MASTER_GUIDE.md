## Publishing Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up Your Series on Hashnode

1. Log in to your Hashnode account
2. Go to Dashboard > Series
3. Click "Create a Series"
4. Configure:
   - Title: "Building a Production-Ready n8n on Azure Kubernetes Service"
   - Description: "A comprehensive guide to deploying n8n workflow automation platform on AKS using first principles and production-grade best practices."
   - Cover image: Upload the series cover (see [Visual Assets](#visual-assets))

### Step 2: Prepare Each Article

For each article in sequence:

1. Create a new article in Hashnode
2. Copy the content from the corresponding markdown file
3. Add the article to your series
4. Set title and meta description from the [SEO Strategy](#seo-strategy) section
5. Add appropriate tags (kubernetes, azure, devops, n8n, automation)
6. Upload or create visual assets
7. Add navigation links between articles

### Step 3: Optimize Publishing Schedule

For maximum impact:

- Publish one article per week
- Best days: Tuesday or Wednesday
- Best time: 9-10 AM in your target audience's timezone
- Maintain consistent scheduling
- Plan for 8 weeks of content
