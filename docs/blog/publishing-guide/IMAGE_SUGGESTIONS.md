## Creating Custom Diagrams

For technical diagrams beyond what's provided in the Markdown files, consider using:

1. **[Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)** (formerly draw.io)
   - Free online diagram editor
   - Has Kubernetes and Azure icons built-in
   - Export as PNG/SVG for Hashnode

2. **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)**
   - Creates hand-drawn style diagrams
   - Simple interface for quick visualizations
   - Good for conceptual illustrations

3. **[Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)**
   - If Hashnode has rendering issues with any Mermaid diagrams
   - Export as PNG/SVG
   - Maintains consistency with existing diagrams

## Image Best Practices for Hashnode

- **File size:** Keep images under 2MB for optimal page loading speed
- **Dimensions:** Recommended cover image size is 1600 x 840 pixels
- **Formats:** PNG for diagrams and screenshots, JPEG for photos
- **Alt text:** Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent style across all articles
- **Attribution:** Include credits for any stock images or icons used

## Custom Infographic Elements

Consider creating these custom infographic elements to enhance your articles:

1. **"n8n Production Readiness Checklist"** - A visual checklist of deployment requirements
2. **"Kubernetes Component Map for n8n"** - Showing which K8s objects correspond to n8n functions
3. **"Performance at Scale"** - Visual representation of how the system handles increasing load
4. **"Security Layers"** - Concentric circles showing security measures at each level

These can be reused across articles where appropriate to maintain visual consistency and reinforce key concepts.
