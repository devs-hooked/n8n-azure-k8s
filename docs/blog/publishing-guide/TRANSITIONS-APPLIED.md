   ```

2. **Navigation Links (Bottom)**  
   Added to the end of each article:
   ```markdown
   ## Series Navigation

   - [Part 1: Introduction & Architecture](#part1-link)

## Important Notes for Publishing

1. **Placeholder Links**  
   All navigation links currently use placeholder URLs (#part1-link, #part2-link, etc.). When publishing on Hashnode:
   - Replace these with actual URLs to the published articles
   - For articles not yet published, update links as each new article is published

2. **Series Link**  
   The [View the complete series here](#series-link) placeholder needs to be replaced with the actual URL to the Hashnode series page once created.

3. **Call-to-Action Customization**  
   Each article has a custom call-to-action question related to its specific topic to encourage reader engagement.

4. **GitHub Repository Link**  
   All articles reference the GitHub repository. Ensure the link is correct: https://github.com/devs-hooked/n8n-azure-k8s

The transitions create a cohesive reading experience across the entire series, making it clear how each article connects to the others and encouraging readers to follow the complete series.
