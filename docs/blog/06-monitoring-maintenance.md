# Monitoring, Maintenance, and Optimization

A production-grade deployment requires robust monitoring, routine maintenance procedures, and performance optimization. In this section, we'll cover:

1. Monitoring strategies for n8n on AKS
2. Maintenance procedures and best practices
3. Performance optimization techniques
4. Cost optimization approaches

## Monitoring Your n8n Deployment

### Key Metrics to Monitor

For an n8n deployment, several metrics are critical to track:

1. **Application Health**:
   - Pod readiness and liveness
   - API response times
   - Error rates in logs
   - Webhook reliability

2. **Infrastructure Metrics**:
   - CPU and memory usage across all components
   - Storage usage and growth rate
   - Network traffic patterns
   - Queue length and processing times

3. **Database Performance**:
   - Query execution times
   - Connection pool utilization
   - Database size growth
   - Transaction rates

### Implementing Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor provides comprehensive monitoring for AKS clusters. We implemented it with:

```bash
# Enable Azure Monitor for container insights
az aks enable-addons -a monitoring -n n8n-cluster -g n8n-aks-rg
```

This enables:
- Container metrics collection
- Log aggregation
- Performance dashboards
- Alert configuration

### Creating Custom Dashboards

We created custom dashboards in Azure portal for n8n-specific metrics:

1. **n8n Operations Dashboard**:
   - Workflow execution rates
   - Error percentages
   - API request volumes
   - Active user sessions

2. **Infrastructure Health Dashboard**:
   - Pod status across namespaces
   - Node resource utilization
   - Storage consumption
   - Networking metrics

### Setting Up Alerts

Critical alerts were configured for:

1. **High Severity**:
   - Any pod in Failed or CrashLoopBackOff state
   - Database or Redis unavailability
   - Worker queue backlog exceeding thresholds
   - Certificate expiration warnings

2. **Medium Severity**:
   - CPU or memory usage above 80% for over 15 minutes
   - Persistent storage approaching capacity
   - High error rates in application logs
   - Unusual traffic patterns (potential security issues)

### Log Management

For comprehensive log management, we configured:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: fluentd-config
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  fluent.conf: |
    # Log collection and forwarding configuration
    # Details omitted for brevity
```

This configuration:
- Collects container logs across the cluster
- Enriches logs with metadata (namespace, pod name, etc.)
- Forwards logs to Azure Log Analytics
- Enables structured querying and analytics

## Maintenance Procedures

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

We implemented a comprehensive backup strategy:

1. **Database Backups**:
   - Daily full backups retained for 30 days
   - Point-in-time recovery capability
   - Geo-redundant storage for backups
   - Automated validation of backup integrity

Implementation using a CronJob:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: postgres-backup
  namespace: n8n
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Run daily at 2 AM
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: postgres-backup
            image: postgres:13
            command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
            args:
            - |
              pg_dump -h postgres-service -U n8n -d n8n | gzip > /backups/n8n-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz
              # Upload to Azure Blob Storage
              az storage blob upload --account-name n8nbackups --container-name backups --name n8n-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz --file /backups/n8n-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz
            volumeMounts:
            - name: backup-volume
              mountPath: /backups
            env:
            - name: PGPASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: n8n-secret
                  key: DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD
          volumes:
          - name: backup-volume
            emptyDir: {}
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

2. **Disaster Recovery Plan**:
   - Documented recovery procedures
   - Regular DR testing (quarterly)
   - Recovery time objective (RTO): 2 hours
   - Recovery point objective (RPO): 24 hours

### Update Strategy

For keeping the deployment up-to-date, we established:

1. **n8n Version Updates**:
   - Monthly update schedule
   - Canary deployment approach (update one pod, validate, then update others)
   - Rollback procedures documented and tested

2. **Kubernetes and Infrastructure Updates**:
   - Quarterly AKS version assessment
   - Security patches applied promptly
   - Node recycling strategy (one node at a time)

Update implementation with zero-downtime:

```bash
# Update n8n with rolling deployment
kubectl set image deployment/n8n n8n=n8nio/n8n:new-version -n n8n

# Wait for rollout to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment/n8n -n n8n

# If issues detected, rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/n8n -n n8n
```

### Maintenance PowerShell Script

We created a maintenance PowerShell script for routine operations:

```powershell
# manage-n8n.ps1 - Common management operations

param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [ValidateSet("status", "logs", "restart", "scale", "backup")]
    [string]$Operation,
    
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
    [string]$Component = "n8n",
    
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
    [int]$Replicas = 0
)

# Script implementation omitted for brevity
# See full script in the repository
```

This script simplifies common maintenance tasks and ensures consistent procedures.

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Tuning

Based on performance monitoring, we optimized resource allocations:

1. **n8n Workers**:
   - Increased memory allocation to 1.5Gi for complex workflows
   - Fine-tuned CPU requests based on actual usage patterns
   - Adjusted HPA thresholds to scale earlier

2. **PostgreSQL**:
   - Optimized shared_buffers and work_mem settings
   - Implemented connection pooling with PgBouncer
   - Added indexes for frequently queried fields

Implementation for PostgreSQL tuning:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: postgres-config
  namespace: n8n
data:
  postgresql.conf: |
    shared_buffers = 256MB
    work_mem = 16MB
    maintenance_work_mem = 64MB
    effective_cache_size = 768MB
    max_connections = 100
    # Additional optimized settings omitted for brevity
```

### n8n Configuration Optimization

We fine-tuned n8n configuration based on production usage patterns:

1. **Workflow Execution Settings**:
   - Adjusted `EXECUTIONS_PROCESS` for optimal resource usage
   - Configured execution timeout parameters for long-running workflows
   - Optimized retry mechanisms for external service connections

2. **Queue Management**:
   - Implemented queue priority settings for critical workflows
   - Configured dedicated queues for different workflow types
   - Optimized job concurrency settings per worker

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Right-Sizing

We implemented several cost optimization strategies:

1. **Node Pools and VM Sizing**:
   - Used Azure Spot Instances for worker nodes (50-80% cost savings)
   - Implemented node auto-scaling to reduce idle capacity
   - Right-sized VM types based on actual usage patterns

2. **Storage Optimization**:
   - Implemented log retention policies
   - Used premium storage only for performance-critical components
   - Set up automatic storage cleanup for temporary data

### Cost Analysis

We conducted a comprehensive cost analysis:

```
Monthly Cost Breakdown:
- AKS Nodes (2 x D2s v3): $140.16
- Storage (Premium SSD, 64 GB): $10.44
- Networking (Load Balancer, Outbound): $23.00
- Monitoring: $7.50
- Backups: $5.20
----------------------------------
Total Estimated Monthly Cost: $186.30
```

Cost optimization reduced the original estimate by approximately 30%.

```

## Health Checks and Validation

### Comprehensive Health Check Script

We created a comprehensive health check script to verify all components:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# health-check.sh - Verify all components of n8n deployment

echo "Checking pod status..."
kubectl get pods -n n8n

echo "Checking service endpoints..."
kubectl get endpoints -n n8n

echo "Checking certificate status..."
kubectl get certificate -n n8n

echo "Checking database connection..."
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=n8n -n n8n -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -n n8n -- \
  node -e "const { Pool } = require('pg'); const pool = new Pool({connectionString: process.env.DB_POSTGRESDB_URL}); pool.query('SELECT NOW()', (err, res) => { console.log(err || res.rows[0]); pool.end(); })"

echo "Checking Redis connection..."
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=n8n -n n8n -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -n n8n -- \
  node -e "const Redis = require('ioredis'); const redis = new Redis(process.env.QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST); redis.ping().then(res => { console.log(res); redis.disconnect(); })"

echo "Checking external access..."
curl -I https://n8n.behooked.co
```

This script provides a quick way to validate all aspects of the deployment.
